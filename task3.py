"""
(6 points) A perceptron can only be used for binary classification, however, the Iris dataset has 3 classes:
setosa, versicolor and virginica. If you are only allowed to use perceptrons but the number is not limited,
how would you like to perform a multiclass classification for the Iris data set (all features)? Please write a
program (demo) for this task using the new perceptron class developed in the previous task.
